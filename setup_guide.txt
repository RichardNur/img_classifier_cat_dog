Project Setup Guide: Cat vs. Dog Classifier

This project classifies images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The project includes training the model and using it to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

Install the required dependencies:
Use requirements.txt to install all necessary dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt


Prepare your data:
	•	Place your training and validation images in the appropriate folders:
	•	data/train/cat/ for cat images
	•	data/train/dog/ for dog images
	•	data/validation/cat/ for cat validation images
	•	data/validation/dog/ for dog validation images
	•	You can use your own dataset or download one, such as from Kaggle.

Training the Model:
To train the model, run the train.py script. This will use the images in the data/train directory to train
the CNN model and save the model in the model/ directory as model.h5.

During training, the model will learn to differentiate between cat and dog images.
Once training is complete, the model will be saved as model/model.h5.

Making Predictions:
After the model is trained, you can use the predict.py script to make predictions on new images.
	•	Place your test image in the example_imgs/ folder.
	•	Run the script and provide the image name (without the .jpg extension) when prompted

The script will load the trained model and predict whether the image contains a cat or a dog.
